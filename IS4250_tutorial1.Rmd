This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
data(cars)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cars,aes(speed,dist))
p<-ggplot(cars,aes(speed,dist))
p
p+geom_point()
dplyr::filter(cars, speed==4)
 speed dist
1     4    2
2     4   10
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
